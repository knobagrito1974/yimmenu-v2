## ❗ Common Issues

### 🔹 I get desynced from public sessions every five minutes

A BattlEye bypass is not available.
Legitimate hosts will eventually remove you because of heartbeat failure.
There is currently **no way to prevent this** except using a private bypass.

---

### 🔹 I removed FSL and all my progress disappeared

FSL reroutes all save data to disk.
Any progress made while using FSL will only appear **when FSL is enabled**.
You *can* use YimMenuV2 without FSL, but it is **not recommended**.

---

### 🔹 I removed FSL and the game no longer starts

This is a known issue.
To fix it, delete:

```
Documents/GTAV Enhanced/Profiles
```
